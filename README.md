## Windows installation

Java 11 runtime containing JavaFX classes is needed for running this JavaFX app.  
The easiest way is to use Liberica 11 JRE (**full** version). I used this version [Liberica Full JRE 11.0.12+7 x86 64 bit](https://download.bell-sw.com/java/11.0.12+7/bellsoft-jre11.0.12+7-windows-amd64-full.msi)

After installing Java create a directory anywhere (e.g. C:\Users\<username>\key-manager) and copy application *.jar file with [app.properties](app.properties) configuration file into created directory.  


Create a shortcut to *.jar file and place it to windows startup directory (you can find it by going to Start -> Run and executing command _shell:startup_)
