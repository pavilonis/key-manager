## Windows installation

Java 11 runtime containing JavaFX classes is needed for running this JavaFX app.  
The easiest way is to use Liberica 11 JRE **full** version, e.g. [Liberica Full JRE 11.0.12+7 x86 64 bit](https://download.bell-sw.com/java/11.0.12+7/bellsoft-jre11.0.12+7-windows-amd64-full.msi)

After installing Java create a directory anywhere (e.g. C:\Users\<username>\key-manager).  
Download [application *.jar file](https://github.com/pavilonis/key-manager/releases) and [app.properties](app.properties) configuration (update with your values) into created directory.  

Create a shortcut to *.jar file and place it to windows startup directory.  
You can find startup directory by going to Start -> Run and executing command `shell:startup`)
